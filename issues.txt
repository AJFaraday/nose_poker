Issues:

* JSON rep of the final score ordered by round desc, then final_score desc

```json
[
  {
    ogre: 'ajfarday/test_answer',
    round: 3,
    final_score: 0
  },
  ...
]
```

Nice to haves

Some HTML UI displaying the results (no in-browser game today)
- Can this add anything to the widget table? (e.g. some kind of charts)?

Plan

* Make the game work (tick)
* Import answers (tick)
* Record data in visible location
* Write up API (tick)
* Write up challenge, sandbox (tick)

# Nose Poker

## The Game

An ogre game, played by ogres.

Each ogre starts with a large nose and a small club. 

Each hand they will declare a number of times that they
will poke their nose with their club. The one who declares the least number of times is out of the game
for cowardice. 

The rest will poke their noses their declared amount of times and if they have a nose left after
that hand, they will go on to the next hand.
